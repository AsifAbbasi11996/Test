		<h3>Intermediate</h3>
		<p>It's the two-year period between your highschool and college. You have passed the highschool already; but before enrolling as an undergraduate in a college, you will have to complete two more years of schooling - those two years are intermediate education.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="course-col">
		<h3>Degree</h3>
		<p>When people loosely refer to a "college" degree, more often than not they're referring to a four-year, undergraduate bachelor's degree. However, there are several categories of undergraduate degrees, which also include associate degrees. Undergraduate degrees are also referred to as post-secondary degrees.</p>
